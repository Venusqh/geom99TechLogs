    - Masking layers in AGOL
      + The live data source of earthquake data is worldwide, need to show Canada and the US only
      + Steps: 
          i. Add the 'world countries' layer from LivingAtlas > apply condition (filter): 'country name' is 'Canada' OR 'United States' > make sure the symbology is not transparent
          ii. Add the live earthquake layer to web map > group the two layers
          iii. Select the earthquake layer > properties > appearance > blending > compositing > source in (ensure keeping top layer overlaps, non-overlaps and background layer is transparent)
    - Apply styles (custom symbology, attributes) on earthquake layer
    - Aggregate point features, adjust clustering settings
  * Website development
    - Title page writings
    - Five sections: intro, problem statement, methodologies, solutions, team contact
    - Problem statement page build up

3. Outcomes (what you completed) 
  * Finished problem statement
  * Perfect live earthquake layer

4. Next steps
  * Double check with Shawn about the problem statement
  * Apply more configurations with Arcade expressions on web map, e.g. pop-up and label
  * Keep working on web map visualization, as all the natural hazards layers are showing together, balance the look
  * Website introduction and solutions sections 

5. Resources (links, reminders, etc.)
